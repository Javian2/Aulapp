## Project description

Rutapear is a platform that allows you to organise, manage and visualise gastronomic routes. To give context, a gastronomic route is a gastronomic event usually focused on a main product or theme where several establishments participate. During the event, people have to visit each of the participating establishments with the idea of tasting the product offered. Normally, people follow a map or similar that shows each of the restaurants participating in the event as well as their location with the help of a map.

Going back to the project, first of all, the event organisers have the possibility to create a route and add to it the different establishments that will participate. To do this, the platform has a Firebase database where all the information of each of the gastronomic routes is stored. The idea is that the system administrator receives the information and is responsible for adding it.

On the other hand, users have a mobile application where they can view each of the routes currently available. At the same time, they can also interact with them in order to view the participating restaurants, find out their location as well as the product they offer, find out which establishments have been visited, etc.

## Technologies used

- Ionic
- Cordova
- Typescript
- Sass
