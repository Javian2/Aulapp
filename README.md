# Aulapp

## Project description

Aulapp is a web platform that allows private classes to be given completely online. 

Teachers register in order to give classes on a specific subject, thus having different management tools such as the available timetable, calendar, control of classes and requests for teaching and management of subjects that can be taught. 

On the other hand, people who wish to receive classes on a specific subject register and search for teachers according to their needs. Once they have found the ideal teacher, they will request a class with him/her according to the timetable available. 

As mentioned above, classes are conducted online through a video call system that is incorporated into the platform itself. Access to this video call will be enabled minutes before the start of the agreed class. Within the video call interface itself, there are interactive resources in the form of 3D models that can facilitate the teacher's explanation, depending on the subject in question. 

Finally, the platform administrator has a management panel with all the activities that are carried out on the platform as well as the different students and teachers. Also, the administrator has different statistics that allow to know the activity of the platform as well as its performance.
